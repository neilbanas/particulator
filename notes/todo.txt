BUGS TO FIX



NUMERICS TO TEST

* how does interpn for velocity behave relative to the 1-D-at-a-time interpolation used in particulator-java?

* figure out how to handle interpolation of tracers near land, since tracer fields are nan there (see modelRun_romsCascadia.loadFrame and .interpTracer)

* look carefully at x,y vs lon,lat for large grids. For now, working only in
the units used in the grid, calling these x,y, and converting velocities for
each particle at each timestep. I don't see why this wouldn't work, but it's
not what I ended up doing in the Processing version of particulator.
 
* the vertical random walk is behaving well according to a rough eyeball test, but it might warrant simplifying or complexifying.



FEATURES TO ADD

* test better that output from dir() that I assume to be numbered sequentially
actually is numbered sequentially

* horizontal dispersion in depth-averaged particle tracking

* the treatment of vertical coordinates in ROMS isn't fully general

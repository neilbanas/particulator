BUGS TO FIX



NUMERICS TO TEST

* how does interpn for velocity behave relative to the 1-D interpolation used in particulator-java?

* figure out how to handle interpolation of tracers near land, since tracer fields are nan there (see modelRun_romsCascadia.loadFrame and .interpTracer)

* look carefully at x,y vs lon,lat for large grids. For now, working only in
the units used in the grid, calling these x,y, and converting velocities for
each particle at each timestep. I don't see why this wouldn't work, but it's
not what I ended up doing in the Processing version of particulator.
 


FEATURES TO ADD

* test better that output from dir() that I assume to be numbered sequentially
actually is numbered sequentially

* allow sigmaTrapLevel or zTrapLevel to be a two-element vector, meaning an average over a range

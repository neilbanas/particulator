x,y		the native horizontal coordinates of the model;
		not necessarily the same units as u,v

z		vertical position (presumably in m)
sigma	relative vertical position, -1 for seabed, 0 for surface
H		bottom depth, from mean sea level. sigma = -1 <==> z = -H
zeta	free surface height. sigma = 0 <==> z = zeta

t		time, in units consistent with u,v,w
u,v,w	advective velocities in x,y,z directions
Ks		vertical diffusivity for tracers
wdiff	random-walk vertical velocity representing diffusion
dksdz	a first-order correction to the vertical diffusion velocity
		(a "random displacement" scheme)--in practice diffusion should always
		be represented as (wdiff + dksdz)

n,k,j,i	indices in t,z,y,x directions
N,K,J,I	size of a matrix in t,z,y,x directions


standard internal names for tracers:

temp	temperature
salt	salinity
ice		ice cover
iceh	ice thickness
swrad	shortwave radiation (PAR is usually 0.43 * swrad)
